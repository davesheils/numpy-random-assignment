# Programming for Data Analysis: Assignment 2018 (November 2018)

In addition to the gitignore and license, this repository contains the following documents:

* A [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/davesheils/numpy-random-assignment/blob/master/Numpy-Random.ipynb) containing work for this assignment
* [Assignment Instructions](https://github.com/davesheils/numpy-random-assignment/blob/master/programming%20data%20analysis%20assignment.pdf) in PDF format

Windows and Mac users will need to run the Jupyter Notebook software in order to view the Jupyter Notebook (this may not be necessary in some linux distributions, such as Ubuntu). Users will also have to have Python 3.6 installed as well as the numpy, pyplot and pandas library.
